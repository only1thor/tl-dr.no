# LibreTranslate

For locally hosted translations.

works fine via webgui, and shows example of api request, and repsonse for the given translation request (in addition to the regular gui response).

## Android app
The [LibreTranslator](https://codeberg.org/BeoCode/LibreTranslator) android app requires valid SSL, but does not give you a warning that that is the issue. it just never loads a response. (even when doing http directly to an ip..).

The API from LibreTranslate returns alternative translations, but these are not exposed in the app. I wish they were. 

I have not found any other apps that use the LibreTranslate API.
