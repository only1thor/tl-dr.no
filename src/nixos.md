# NixOs notes

NixOs has given me an fast route to reinstall my server, and therfore lowering the time it takes to get back up and running after a failure.

Also the flow of using NixOs, "change the config, rebuild, test, commit" is a nice way to work with a server, as its quick to see the changes work, and easy to revert if something goes wrong.
