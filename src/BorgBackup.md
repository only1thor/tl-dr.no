# BorgBackup

### points to write about
- [ ] borg backup cannot backup to a repo that is currently mounted (e.g. fuse mount to get files from an old backup)
- [ ] nix borgbackup service, and point out the doInit function.
- [ ] notes on the append only key on borgbase and the drawbacks of borg serverside pruning. (timed attack can delete all backups)
- [ ] keyfiles and how to use them with borgbackup, and that all keys have a passphrase, that may be null.


### stuff learn about
- [ ] secrets management with nix.
- [ ] secrets management with podman. (is an env file ok? maybe use bitwarden?)
