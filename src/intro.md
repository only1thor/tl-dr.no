# Introduction
These notes should not be to long, so i actually read them.

The current plan is to orgainze destinct projects or topics in their own "chapters" (since this tool is ment to create books).
And sub-chapters for smaller parts, like a pice of the project, or an attempt at a solution, that did not work out.
